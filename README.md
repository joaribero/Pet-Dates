# Simple React App to manage pet dates

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Build with only react and js. Beside React libraries, I use "uuid" to generate id's for the dates.

## To Test It:
- View it in the browser [Citas](https://tender-mayer-11489e.netlify.app/)
- Clone the repository locally and run the command `npm start`
